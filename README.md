SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction – IBM Capstone Project
This project focuses on predicting the successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9’s first stage using historical launch data. Accurate prediction of landings can significantly reduce mission costs by enabling rocket reusability.

Key steps in the project include:
Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
Built and evaluated classification models to identify critical factors influencing landing success.
Aimed to support decision-making for efficient and cost-effective space missions.

Tech Stack / Tools Used
Python – Core language for data analysis and modeling

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and numerical computation

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Static and interactive visualizations

Scikit-learn – Classification model building and evaluation

BeautifulSoup – Web scraping of SpaceX launch data

SQL – Querying and filtering launch records from a relational database

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment for analysis
